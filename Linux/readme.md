<h3 align=center>It is important to note before we begin that the installation process will vary between flavours or distributions of linux.</h3>
<h1></h1>
<p>
<h4 align=center>This guide will cater to: Debian (Ubuntu), Arch (Manjaro), RPM (Fedora) </h4>

<h4 align=center><u>You should match your distro to one of these three types</u></h4>
</p>
<h1></h1>

<h3><p>If you are not using one of these types or distributions, your package manager may include virtual box, this is generally up to date
and stable. However, if it is not listed then you will have to check on the creator's page for either source, or an installation.

The installation is typically the same across any distribution with maybe Gentoo based being the odd one out, however the general form:
Package Manager, Source, Original Creator, should have a supported version.

<b><u>You should follow, and only need to follow one.</u></b>
